# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
In this example, onAnimationEnd is used, this is the event handler – animationEnd, which is called when the element’s CSS animation ends. The component does not use third party libraries and when the menu is hidden, it is not in the DOM.
For start:
npm install
npm run dev
